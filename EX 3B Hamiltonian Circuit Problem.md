# EX 3B Hamiltonian Circuit Problem
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to check whether Hamiltonian path exits in the given graph.


## Algorithm
1. Start with a graph represented using an adjacency matrix and initialize a path list to store the Hamiltonian path.
2. Fix the first vertex in the path since the Hamiltonian path must start somewhere.
3. Use backtracking to add one vertex at a time to the path and check if it is safe to add by ensuring itâ€™s adjacent and not already included.
4. If all vertices are added to the path and the last vertex connects to the first, a Hamiltonian cycle is found. 
5. If no such path can be formed, return false and conclude that no Hamiltonian path exists.

## Result:
The Hamiltonian path program executed successfully, and it determined whether a Hamiltonian path exists in the given graph.
