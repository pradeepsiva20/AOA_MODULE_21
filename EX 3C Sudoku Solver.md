# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1. Start by scanning the Sudoku grid to find the first empty cell (represented by 0).
2. Try placing digits 1 to 9 in the empty cell and check if the number is safe to place (i.e., not repeated in its row, column, or 3Ã—3 subgrid).
3. If the number is valid, place it and recursively try to fill in the rest of the grid.
4. If placing any number leads to a dead end, backtrack by resetting the cell and trying the next number. 
5. Repeat this process until the grid is completely filled, printing the result once a solution is found.
